This is the directory for the startup web application.

Access in VS code has been achieved.
Access in GitHub has been achieved.
Merge change part #1.
Merge change part #2.

GitHub notes: GitHub is a great way to backup my code. Pulling and pushing changes seem to be limited to the console on my computer. The console seems to be the best way for me to deal with the backup/syncing aspect of coding in this class.

Set up a web server with AWS.

I found it interesting that it costs you the same amount regardless of whether your server is running or not running (at least when using an elastic IP address).

Browser address: http://3.15.70.3

Remote shell command: ssh -i ~/Desktop/finish.delete.Open\ Tabs/,schoolwork/CS\ 260/production.pem ubuntu@3.15.70.3



1/30/23 (C4LV1NPU6):

Set up domain name with AWS.

I found it interesting that my preferred domain name wasn't taken yet.

Domain name: http://startup.lightbikebattle.click/



2/2/23 (C4LV1NPU6):

Secured web server communication by configuring Caddy to request a certificate from Let's Encrypt for the domain name.

I found it interesting that we didn't start with https.

Host name: https://startup.lightbikebattle.click/



2/6/23 (C4LV1NPU6):

Set up official HTML website.

I found it interesting that I had to change my startup URL from cs260game.lightbikebattle.click to startup.lightbikebattle.click.

Site name: https://lightbikebattle.click/

Website deploy command: ./deployWebsite.sh -k ~/Desktop/finish.delete.Open\ Tabs/,schoolwork/CS\ 260/production.pem -h lightbikebattle.click



2/6/23 (C4LV1NPU6):

Set up Simon HTML sub-website.

I learned how to implement the Simon Game web application using only HTML. This included the layout and functions for the about, home, play, and scores pages. It was a lot of information but I studied it and copied it perfectly.

Sub-site name: https://simon.lightbikebattle.click/

Sub-site deploy command: ./deployFiles.sh -k ~/Desktop/finish.delete.Open\ Tabs/,schoolwork/CS\ 260/production.pem -h lightbikebattle.click -s simon

Made CSS Practice project. Can be used in Startup App's website.

I found the typing animation interesting.

2/13/23 (C4LV1NPU6):

Made CSS Flex project. Can be used in Startup App's website.

I found it interesting how HTML passes variables to CSS.
